# master-tal-semantiweb-yahoo
As part of collaborative work between Inalco and the company SémantiWeb, this project proposed us an introductory step to the Opinion Mining problems with a rules-based system. Its main task was to build a corpus using data from public forums on the web and extracted linguistics patterns that express any kind of user's consuming desire or user's personal information (his gender, age, job or education background). During this work, we develop our capabilities to build regex in a heuristic way with a data mining perspective. This work was realized on the Yahoo Answer Forum, using the pages in Portuguese.
